# MipsProject1
   
This is a MIPS assembly program that counts either the number of 0's or 1's in the binary representation of a given integer. This program prompts the user for 3 values. First it prompts the user to enter an integer. Next it prompts the user to enter which byte position that are interested (0 - 3). Finally it prompts the user whether they would like to count the number of 0's or 1's that make up the binary representation of the integer.   

Following are the two sample runs of the program, using the MARS 4.5 IDE.   

Please enter an integer > user input : 9987   
Please enter Byte position (0 - 3) > user input :1   
Please enter a bit to sum (0 or 1) > user input :1   
The number of 1's in 9987 is: 4

Please enter an integer > user input : 9987   
Please enter Byte position (0 - 3) > user input : 0   
Please enter a bit to sum (0 or 1) > user input : 0   
The number of 0's in 9987 is: 6
